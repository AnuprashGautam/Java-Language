# In Java the size of byte datatype is 1 byte whose range is -128 to 127 and MSB is used to denote the sign bit. Now you tell me thoroughly that how the values are represeneted in the bit level?

In Java, the `byte` data type uses **8 bits** to represent values, and it is a **signed** data type. This means that one of the bits (the most significant bit or MSB) is used to represent the sign of the number. Here's a breakdown of how values are represented at the bit level:

### Positive Numbers (0 to 127)
For positive values (0 to 127), the MSB (most significant bit) is `0`, indicating a positive number. The remaining 7 bits represent the magnitude of the number in binary.

#### Example 1: `byte` value `5`
- **Decimal:** 5
- **Binary:** `0000 0101`
  - MSB is `0`, indicating it's positive.
  - Remaining bits represent `5` in binary.

#### Example 2: `byte` value `127` (maximum positive value)
- **Decimal:** 127
- **Binary:** `0111 1111`
  - MSB is `0`, indicating it's positive.
  - Remaining bits represent `127` in binary.

### Negative Numbers (-1 to -128)
For negative values (-1 to -128), the MSB is `1`, indicating a negative number. The remaining bits represent the **two's complement** of the absolute value of the number. In two's complement, the binary representation of a negative number is obtained by:
1. Taking the binary representation of the positive counterpart.
2. Inverting all the bits (changing `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).
3. Adding `1` to the result.

#### Example 3: `byte` value `-1`
- **Step 1:** Take the binary of `1`: `0000 0001`
- **Step 2:** Invert the bits: `1111 1110`
- **Step 3:** Add `1`: `1111 1111`
  - MSB is `1`, indicating it's negative.
  - Remaining bits represent `-1` in two's complement form.

#### Example 4: `byte` value `-128` (minimum value for `byte`)
- **Binary:** `1000 0000`
  - MSB is `1`, indicating it's negative.
  - The remaining bits represent `-128` in two's complement form (this is a special case because -128 is the lowest representable value in 8-bit two's complement, so it has a direct binary representation).

### Summary:
- **Positive values (0 to 127)**: MSB is `0`, and the remaining bits represent the value.
- **Negative values (-1 to -128)**: MSB is `1`, and the remaining bits are the two's complement of the absolute value.

### Bit Structure:
- The most significant bit (MSB) determines the sign:
  - `0` for positive values
  - `1` for negative values
- The remaining 7 bits store the magnitude (for positive values) or the two's complement (for negative values).
