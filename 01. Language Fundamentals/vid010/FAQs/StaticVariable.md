# Hoe the static term is appropriate for the static variable?

The term "static" in the context of a static variable is justified because it reflects the variable's fixed, unchanging relationship to the class. Here's how the term "static" is appropriate:

1. **Unchanging Association with the Class**:
   - The word "static" generally means "stationary" or "unchanging." In the case of a static variable, it is tied to the class itself rather than to any instance of the class. This means the variable's association with the class remains constant, no matter how many objects of the class are created or destroyed. The variable does not "move" or change its association to a particular instance, hence it is "static."

2. **Single Memory Allocation**:
   - A static variable is allocated memory only once, when the class is loaded. This is in contrast to instance variables, which are allocated memory each time a new object is created. Since a static variable's memory allocation remains "static" or fixed during the runtime of the program, the term is fitting.

3. **Consistent State Across Instances**:
   - Since a static variable maintains the same value across all instances of the class, its state is "static" in the sense that it doesn't vary between different objects. Any changes to the variable are reflected globally across all instances, which reinforces the idea of a fixed or "static" value.

In essence, the term "static" emphasizes the variable's constant, unchanging relationship to the class rather than to instances of the class, making it an appropriate descriptor.
