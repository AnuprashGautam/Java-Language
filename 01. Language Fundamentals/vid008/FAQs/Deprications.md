Deprecation in Java occurs when a class, method, or feature is marked as **outdated** or **no longer recommended for use**. This does not mean the feature is immediately removed, but it signals to developers that a more modern or efficient alternative exists. Over time, deprecated features may eventually be removed from the language in future versions.

In your code, the use of `new Integer()`, `new Long()`, and `new Float()` has been deprecated. Here's why:

### 1. **Autoboxing (Since Java 5)**
Java introduced **autoboxing** and **unboxing** in Java 5, which automatically converts between primitive types (like `int`, `long`, `float`) and their corresponding wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Long`, `Float`). This removed the need to explicitly create objects using `new`.

#### Before Java 5 (Manual Boxing):
```java
Integer num = new Integer(4);
```

#### After Java 5 (Autoboxing):
```java
Integer num = 4;   // Autoboxing happens automatically
```

### **Why `new Integer()`, `new Long()`, `new Float()` Were Deprecated:**
- **Performance Issues**: Manually creating wrapper objects using `new` incurs unnecessary memory allocation, creating new objects every time, even if the value is the same. Autoboxing makes the code more efficient, reusing cached values for frequently used numbers (e.g., small integers).
  
  For example:
  ```java
  Integer a = new Integer(4);  // Always creates a new Integer object
  Integer b = 4;               // Uses a cached Integer object from the Integer pool
  ```

- **Simplicity and Readability**: Autoboxing makes the code cleaner and more readable, removing boilerplate and making it easier to write code that deals with primitive and wrapper types.

### 2. **Improved Design Philosophy**
Over time, Java's design philosophy has evolved to emphasize:
- **Minimizing object creation**: Creating unnecessary objects can lead to performance penalties like increased garbage collection.
- **Encouraging clean, efficient code**: Modern language features such as autoboxing make code easier to read and maintain.

### **Alternatives to Deprecated Features**:
- Instead of `new Integer(4)`, simply write `Integer a = 4;`
- Instead of `new Long(5L)`, use `Long b = 5L;`
- Instead of `new Float(5.0f)`, use `Float c = 5.0f;`

### **Other Deprecated Features (General Reasons)**

Java deprecates features for several common reasons:
1. **Better Alternatives**: A new, more efficient, or safer alternative has been introduced.
2. **Design Flaws**: The original feature might have design flaws that can't be easily fixed without breaking backward compatibility.
3. **Security Concerns**: Some APIs may have security vulnerabilities that are no longer safe to use.
4. **Improved Performance**: Deprecated APIs might cause performance degradation, and better options may be available.
5. **Obsolescence**: The feature may be based on outdated technology, libraries, or design patterns that are no longer in use or recommended.

### Deprecation as a Signal
Deprecation doesn't immediately break existing code, but it serves as a signal for developers to migrate to better practices and prepare for future changes. Over time, as developers adopt these alternatives, deprecated features can eventually be removed from the language.

In the context of your code, using **autoboxing** is the modern and recommended approach, offering cleaner and more efficient code.
