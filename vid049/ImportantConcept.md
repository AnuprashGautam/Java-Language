# Can we replace interfaces with abstract classes?

- Practically it is posiible but both of them has their own field of use.
- Using abstract class instead of interface will reduce the inheritence. Because a class can extend only one class, while an interface can extend multiple interfaces.
- Secondly, abstract will be time costly as it has constructor, so it will be taking more time in running than interfaces.
