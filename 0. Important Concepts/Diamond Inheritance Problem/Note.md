# What is diamond inhertance problem in java? How can we solve it?

The diamond inheritance problem arises in multiple inheritance scenarios where a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from the same base class. In Java, this problem is avoided because Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes (a class cannot extend more than one class). Instead, Java uses interfaces to achieve similar functionality without the diamond problem.

Here's a brief explanation of how to solve this using interfaces:

1. **Define the Base Interface:**
   Define a common interface that will be inherited by other interfaces or classes.

2. **Define Derived Interfaces:**
   Define interfaces that extend the base interface.

3. **Implement the Interfaces in the Class:**
   Create a class that implements the derived interfaces.

Here's a concrete example:

```java
// Base interface
interface Base {
    void baseMethod();
}

// Derived interface 1
interface Derived1 extends Base {
    void derived1Method();
}

// Derived interface 2
interface Derived2 extends Base {
    void derived2Method();
}

// Implementing class
class ConcreteClass implements Derived1, Derived2 {
    @Override
    public void baseMethod() {
        System.out.println("Base method implementation");
    }

    @Override
    public void derived1Method() {
        System.out.println("Derived1 method implementation");
    }

    @Override
    public void derived2Method() {
        System.out.println("Derived2 method implementation");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcreteClass obj = new ConcreteClass();
        obj.baseMethod();
        obj.derived1Method();
        obj.derived2Method();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `Base` is the common interface.
- `Derived1` and `Derived2` are interfaces that extend `Base`.
- `ConcreteClass` implements both `Derived1` and `Derived2`, providing concrete implementations for all the methods.

This approach ensures that you can have shared behavior (via the `Base` interface) without encountering the diamond problem, as interfaces in Java do not have state and only provide method declarations.
