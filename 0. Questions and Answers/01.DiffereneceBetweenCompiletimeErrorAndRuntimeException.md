# Differences between Compiletime Error and the Runtime Exception

In Java, **runtime exceptions** and **compile-time errors** are two different types of errors that occur during different phases of a program's execution. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

### 1. **Runtime Exception**
- **When it occurs**: During the execution of the program (at runtime).
- **Type**: It is a subclass of `Exception`, specifically under the unchecked exceptions category, meaning it doesn't need to be explicitly declared or caught.
- **Examples**: 
  - `NullPointerException`
  - `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
  - `ArithmeticException` (e.g., divide by zero)
- **Handling**: 
  - You can handle runtime exceptions using try-catch blocks, but you are not required to do so.
  - The program will compile even if the exception is not handled, but if it occurs during execution, it may cause the program to terminate abnormally.

### 2. **Compile-time Error**
- **When it occurs**: During the compilation phase, before the program is executed.
- **Type**: It refers to errors that the compiler catches, preventing the code from compiling. These errors are often related to syntax or the use of incorrect types, missing libraries, or unresolved references.
- **Examples**:
  - Syntax errors (e.g., missing semicolons, mismatched brackets)
  - Type mismatches (e.g., assigning a string to an integer variable)
  - Using undeclared variables or methods
- **Handling**: 
  - You must fix compile-time errors before the program can be compiled and executed.
  - These errors prevent the program from even starting.

### Key Differences:
| **Aspect**            | **Runtime Exception**                          | **Compile-time Error**                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Occurs**            | During program execution                       | During compilation                             |
| **Checked by**        | The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)                 | The Java compiler                              |
| **Type**              | Unchecked exception (subclass of `RuntimeException`) | Errors like syntax, type, or semantic errors   |
| **Program runs?**     | Yes, until the exception occurs at runtime      | No, the program won't compile                  |
| **Example**           | `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` | Missing semicolon, mismatched types            |

In summary, **runtime exceptions** are detected when the program is running, and they can be handled or avoided. **Compile-time errors** must be resolved before the program can even run.
