## 🔍 Why Do We Say Constructors Are Used to Initialize *Instance Variables* When They Can Also Initialize *Static Variables*?

In Java, it's common to hear that **constructors** are used to initialize **instance variables**. However, as you rightly pointed out, we **can** also assign values to **static variables** inside a constructor. So why the emphasis only on instance variables?

Let’s understand this with a detailed explanation.

## 🧱 What is a Constructor?

A **constructor** in Java is a special method used to **initialize objects**. It is automatically called when an object is created.

```java
class C {
    int a;             // Instance variable
    static int b;      // Static variable

    C(int a, int b) {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;   // Possible, but not ideal
    }
}
```

## 🔎 What’s the Difference Between Instance and Static Variables?

| Feature           | Instance Variable (`a`)  | Static Variable (`b`)             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Belongs to        | Each **object**          | The **class** itself              |
| Memory Allocation | Per object               | Shared memory, once per class     |
| Constructor Role  | ✅ Intended to initialize | ⚠️ Possible but **not preferred** |
| Common Use Case   | Setting object state     | Shared constant/config/state      |

## 📌 Example: Assigning Both in Constructor

```java
class C {
    int a;             // Instance variable
    static int b;      // Static variable

    C(int a, int b) {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C child = new C(10, 20);
        System.out.println("a = " + child.a);  // 10
        System.out.println("b = " + child.b);  // 20
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output:

```
a = 10
b = 20
```

Yes, both are assigned. But...

## 🚫 Why It's Not Recommended to Initialize Static Variables in Constructor?

Because:

* **Static variables are shared** among all objects.
* If every object sets the static value differently, it can cause **unexpected behavior**.

### 🧪 Example: Multiple Objects Overwriting Static Value

```java
C obj1 = new C(1, 100);
C obj2 = new C(2, 200);

System.out.println(C.b);  // Output: 200, not 100
```

Even though `obj1` set `b = 100`, `obj2` **overwrote** it to `200`. This breaks the idea of shared, consistent static values.

---

## ✅ Best Way to Initialize Static Variables

### 1. **Direct Initialization**

```java
static int b = 50;
```

### 2. **Static Block**

```java
static {
    b = 50;
}
```

These methods ensure the static variable is initialized **once**, when the class is loaded.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

* ✔ Constructors are **designed** to initialize **instance variables**, which are unique to each object.
* ⚠ While it is **allowed** to assign static variables in constructors, it's **not a best practice**, because static variables are **shared by all objects**.
* 🔁 Initializing static variables in constructors can lead to **unintentional overwriting** when multiple objects are created.
* ✅ Use static blocks or direct assignments to initialize static variables **safely and clearly**.
