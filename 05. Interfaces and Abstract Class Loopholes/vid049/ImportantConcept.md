# Can we replace interfaces with abstract classes?

- Practically it is posiible but both of them has their own field of use.
- Using abstract class instead of interface will reduce the inheritence. Because a single class can only be extended by a class at time. While multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class simultaneously.
- Secondly, abstract class approach will be time costly as it has constructor, so it will be taking more time in running code than interfaces approach.
