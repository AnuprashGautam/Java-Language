# How this code is working?
``` java
public class temp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5 + -4);
    }
}
```
---

In the code example you've provided:

```java
public class temp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5 + -4);
    }
}
```

### How the JVM Handles `5 + -4`:

1. **Unary Minus (`-`)**:
   The `-` before `4` is a **unary minus operator**, which changes the sign of `4`. This means `-4` is the negative form of `4`.

2. **Addition (`+`)**:
   The `+` operator is then applied to `5` and `-4`. In this case, it's performing the operation `5 + (-4)`.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - `5 + (-4)` is simply `5 - 4`, which evaluates to `1`.

### Output:
When you run the program, the result will be:
```
1
```

### Why Thereâ€™s No Error:
Even though it might look unusual with the `+ -` combination, Java handles it perfectly because:
- The `+` is the binary addition operator.
- The `-` is the unary minus operator, which negates the number `4`.

So, `5 + -4` is just another way of writing `5 - 4`, and the JVM evaluates it accordingly.
