# What is the meaning of this >>> operator and why it is used in java? Why there is no such operator <<<?

In Java, the `>>>` operator is known as the **unsigned right shift** operator, and it is used to shift bits of a number to the right, filling the leftmost bits with zero. Here's an explanation of why it exists and why there is no `<<<` operator in Java:

### Explanation of `>>>` Operator

The `>>>` operator shifts the bits of its left-hand operand (a number) to the right by the number of positions specified by its right-hand operand. It **fills the vacated positions with zeros**, regardless of whether the original number was positive or negative. This is why it's called **unsigned right shift**.

- **Syntax**: `x >>> n`
  - `x` is the number to be shifted.
  - `n` is the number of positions to shift.

### Example:
Consider a 32-bit signed integer:
```java
int x = -8;  // In binary: 11111111111111111111111111111000
int result = x >>> 2;
```

- **Binary representation of `-8`**: 
  The 32-bit two's complement binary of `-8` is `11111111111111111111111111111000`.
  
- **After applying `x >>> 2`** (shift by 2 positions):
  - The leftmost 2 bits (the sign bits) will be **zero-filled**, and the rest are shifted to the right.
  - Result in binary: `00111111111111111111111111111110`, which is the unsigned integer `1073741822`.

### Differences Between `>>` and `>>>`

1. **`>>` (Signed Right Shift)**: 
   - This operator shifts the bits to the right while preserving the sign (it fills the leftmost bits with the **sign bit**, either 0 or 1 depending on the original sign of the number).
   - For negative numbers, `>>` fills with 1s, maintaining the number's sign.
   - For positive numbers, it behaves like `>>>` and fills with 0s.
   
   **Example**:
   ```java
   int y = -8;
   int result = y >> 2;  // Result: 11111111111111111111111111111110 (-2)
   ```

2. **`>>>` (Unsigned Right Shift)**:
   - This operator **ignores the sign** and always fills with zeros, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.
   
   **Example**:
   ```java
   int result = y >>> 2;  // Result: 00111111111111111111111111111110 (1073741822)
   ```

### Why There Is No `<<<` Operator in Java?

Java does not have a **`<<<` (unsigned left shift)** operator because the regular **left shift** operator (`<<`) already works for both signed and unsigned values. Here's why:

- **Left shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the left, and fills the rightmost bits with zeros. It doesn't depend on the sign of the number. The leftmost bits are just shifted out, and the sign bit does not change.
  - For both positive and negative numbers, left shifting is the same: bits are moved to the left, and 0s are added to the right.

Since there's no need to treat signed and unsigned values differently when shifting to the left, Java doesn't need a separate **`<<<`** operator.

### Summary:

- **`>>>` (Unsigned Right Shift)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the right, filling the left bits with zeros, ignoring the sign.
- **`>>` (Signed Right Shift)**: Shifts the bits to the right, filling the left bits with the sign bit (1 for negative numbers, 0 for positive).
- **`<<` (Left Shift)**: Shifts bits to the left and fills the rightmost bits with zeros, regardless of the sign.

There is no **`<<<`** operator because the left shift (`<<`) works the same for both signed and unsigned numbers, so there's no need for a separate operator.
