# Exception Handling:

- Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors (unwanted and unexpected) such as division by zero error, file not found error, etc.
- It is a way to handle exceptions that occur during the execution of a program.

# Runtime Stack Mechanism:

- For every thread, JVM will create a runtime stack.
- Each method call is stored in a stack frame/activation record.
- After the method call is completed, the stack frame is removed from the stack.
- In the end, empty stact is destroyed by JVM.
