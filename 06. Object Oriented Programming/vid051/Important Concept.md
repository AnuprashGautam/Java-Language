# Data Hiding:

- It means that the internal data should only be accessed by the person after proper validation.
- It can be achieved by using `private` access modifier.


# Abstraction:

- It means hiding the internal implementation and showing only the necessary details.
- It can be achieved by using `abstract` class and `interface`.


# Encapsulation:

- `Data Hiding` + `Abstraction` = `Encapsulation`.
- It means wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit.


# Tightly Encapsulated Class:

- If a class is `Encapsulated` and all the data members are `private` then it is called `Tightly Encapsulated Class`.
- No matter whether getter and setter methods are present or not and whether these methods are declared as 'public' or not.
- If the parent class is not tightly encapsulated, then no child class can be tightly encapsulated.
